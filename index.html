However, for people living with blindness and low vision, like me, this is our daily life.”</p>
            <p><em>- Alicia Howerton, Cleveland Sight Center staff member and client</em></p>

        <p>In moments of darkness, it is often a <strong>beacon of hope</strong> that allows us to see what is possible on the other end. Throughout 2020, we all lived with uncertainty, fear and isolation due to COVID-19. However, we found hope in new ways. We adapted.</p>
        <p>We, at Cleveland Sight Center, did the same. As we pivoted and found alternative ways to serve our clients, we couldn’t help but be reminded that adapting to something caused by an external force is what our clients are faced with daily.</p>
        <p>Despite the fear and many unknowns that come with being blind or visually impaired, <strong>they choose to be brave every day.</strong></p>
        <p>2020 was no exception for them.</p>
        <p>Our clients – living in a world that is designed for people who are sighted and left without their ability to rely on their sense of touch – adapted to physical distancing and new socialization protocols. Their resilience gave us hope and inspiration.</p>
        <p>Our staff – building on a legacy of innovation and continuous advocacy for our clients – rose to the challenge of finding new and unique methods to deliver services to the blind and visually impaired community via remote and in-person trainings, tele-health sessions and telephone calls. We are excited to carry what we learned this year into our vision for the future.</p>
        <p>Our donors, friends and volunteers – remaining loyal in their support – recognized the needs of our clients and donated their time, talent and treasure to ensure our clients could receive the services they needed to flourish. </p>
        <p><strong>Thank you for being our beacon of hope this past year.</strong> Because of you, we will continue to be a place of hope where every client can walk out our doors (virtual or not) with the confidence to thrive.</p>
        <p>In the stories that follow, we invite you to <strong>“see what’s possible” when people who are blind or visually impaired choose to adapt and overcome obstacles.</strong></p>

    </div>
    <p>In mid-March of 2020, Cleveland Sight Center’s main building closed due to the uncertainties of COVID-19. Similar to many other businesses, we had to quickly pivot our traditional in-person services to a remote service model. For CSC, there was one drastic difference – our clients are blind or visually impaired and rely on their sense of touch during trainings with staff – which limited the amount of remote services we could perform.</p>
    <p>In May, staff recognized that our clients still needed vital in-person services that couldn’t be offered remotely. So, staff followed all safety guidelines, put on their PPE and delivered in-person services – providing essential relief to isolated clients in need throughout the year.</p>
    <p>Together, our clients and staff adapted, overcame obstacles and allowed us to see what is possible by serving 5,522 people through direct services and outreach in innovative ways:</p>

        <p class="text-larger">We are a lifeline for many clients. During a very isolating time, Cleveland Sight Center staff were there for clients when needed most, which was essential to their wellness. Simply offering virtual recreation programs made a huge difference in their lives. </p>

        <h4 class="underline">We can foster independence in new ways</h4>
        <p class="text-larger">Instructing over the phone instead of side-by-side meant clients needed to be more independent. Clients had to learn how to use equipment and read braille without an instructor physically being by their side. By providing instructions over the phone, clients and their families had to do more for themselves, fostering increased independence. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4 pt-5">
        <p class="leading-quote">“Remote training can be even more empowering to our clients because they have to demonstrate they can do a task [compared to] in-person training when we help them step-by-step. Now they have to listen and perform.”</p>

    <h4 class="underline">We can foster independence in new ways</h4>
    <div class="mb-5">
      <p class="text-larger">Advocacy for the blind and visually impaired community is needed now more than ever. In a world designed for people who are sighted, many safety protocols regarding COVID-19 were put in place without full accessibility to people who live with disabilities. For example, arrows on the floor of stores indicating the flow of traffic are not accessible for people without sight. Advocacy, education and outreach efforts to create a more inclusive world for people of all abilities will continue to be a priority for Cleveland Sight Center.</p>

      <p><strong>The future will only be more fruitful because of the lessons learned, and we continue to learn, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We all continue to see “what is possible” because of the resilience of clients, staff, donors and volunteers.</strong></p>
