  <h2>A Message From CSC Leadership</h2>
  <div>In moments of darkness, it is often a beacon of hope that allows us to see what is possible on the other end. Throughout 2020, we all lived with uncertainty, fear and isolation due to COVID-19. However, we found hope in new ways. We adapted. 
    
    We, at Cleveland Sight Center, did the same. As we pivoted and found alternative ways to serve our clients, we couldn’t help but be reminded that adapting to something caused by an external force is what our clients are faced with daily. 
    
    Despite the fear and many unknowns that come with being blind or visually impaired, they choose to be brave every day.
    
    2020 was no exception for them. 
    
    Our clients – living in a world that is designed for people who are sighted and left without their ability to rely on their sense of touch – adapted to physical distancing and new socialization protocols. Their resilience gave us hope and inspiration. 
    
    Our staff – building on a legacy of innovation and continuous advocacy for our clients – rose to the challenge of finding new and unique methods to deliver services to the blind and visually impaired community via remote and in-person trainings, tele-health sessions and telephone calls. We are excited to carry what we learned this year into our vision for the future.
    
    Our donors, friends and volunteers – remaining loyal in their support – recognized the needs of our clients and donated their time, talent and treasure to ensure our clients could receive the services they needed to flourish. 
    
    Thank you for being our beacon of hope this past year. Because of you, we will continue to be a place of hope where every client can walk out our doors (virtual or not) with the confidence to thrive.
    
    In the stories that follow, we invite you to “see what’s possible” when people who are blind or visually impaired choose to adapt and overcome obstacles.</div>
  <div>Howard A. Lichtig 
    Chair, Board of Trustees</div>
  <div>Larry Benders
    President and Chief Executive Officer</div>
  <div>The isolation we are all experiencing [during COVID-19] is a scary and lonely feeling – unable to see our loved ones, unsure of our surroundings and trying to figure out our new normal. However, for people living with blindness and low vision, like me, this is our daily life.”
    - Alicia Howerton, Cleveland Sight Center staff member and client</div>

  <h2>What Did We Do?</h2>
  <div>In mid-March of 2020, Cleveland Sight Center’s main building closed due to the uncertainties of COVID-19. Similar to many other businesses, we had to quickly pivot our traditional in-person services to a remote service model. For CSC, there was one drastic difference – our clients are blind or visually impaired and rely on their sense of touch during trainings with staff – which limited the amount of remote services we could perform.
    
    In May, staff recognized that our clients still needed vital in-person services that couldn’t be offered remotely. So, staff followed all safety guidelines, put on their PPE and delivered in-person services – providing essential relief to isolated clients in need throughout the year.
    
    Together, our clients and staff adapted, overcame obstacles and allowed us to see what is possible by serving 5,522 people through direct services and outreach in innovative ways: </div>
  <div>Bright Futures Preschool continued instruction to students and parents through interactive online group sessions.</div>
  <div>Services were provided to 217 clients and families across 15 counties in Northeast Ohio. </div>
  <div>Virtual instruction to Early Intervention children (0-3) and their caregivers was provided and do-it-yourself tactile projects were mailed home to families.</div>
  <div>Braille instruction classes were taught with students following along with their textbooks over the telephone.</div>
  <div>The Low Vision Clinic conducted tele-health appointments to serve patients.</div>
  <div>823 patients were seen by the Low Vision Clinic to maximize remaing vision</div>
  <div>The Eyedea Shop retail store continued to process and fill orders, shipping essential tools like magnifiers and ‘talking’ devices to 1,487 customers in Ohio and beyond.</div>
  <div>Cleveland Sight Center’s Radio Reading Network (CSCN), social media channels and website featured up-to-date community resources and CSC information regarding COVID-19.   Learn more</div>
  <div>The Recreation team created engaging and interactive activities like meditation, yoga and wellness programs that were conducted online.</div>
  <div>Staff members made phone calls to more than 4,000 clients to check in on their well-being.</div>
  <div>580,729 calls and emails were handled by the Call Center in 2020 with quality scores at 97% and caller satisfaction scores at 96%.</div>
  <div>The Call Center is a social enterprise that employs people who have a work-limiting disability. </div>
  <div>Annual fundraising events including White Cane Walk and the Spellbound Gala pivoted to a virtual format, engaging participants in new and creative ways while raising necessary financial support for the agency.</div>
  <div>The Outreach team continued to deliver educational information about visual impairments through 120 presentations – reaching medical professionals, caregivers and potential clients. </div>
  <div>Employment Services continued to provide job development and training services by quickly pivoting to a virtual format which resulted in being able to expand services to include Akron and Youngstown. </div>

  <h2>What Did We Learn?</h2>
  <div>Transportation is not a barrier</div>
  <div>People who are blind or visually impaired are often unable to drive and have difficulties accessing public transportation. We learned that transportation does not have to be a barrier to access many of our services. Now, services are successfully provided remotely and engagement is no longer limited because of those unable to visit the building.</div>
  <div>“I am so happy that you are hosting virtual dance and yoga. I typically am unable to leave my apartment because of my health concerns. I love to dance, and now I get to do it from my living room with all of my CSC friends!” 
    
    -CSC Client</div>
  <div>We are a lifeline for our clients</div>
  <div>We are a lifeline for many clients. During a very isolating time, Cleveland Sight Center staff were there for clients when needed most, which was essential to their wellness. Simply offering virtual recreation programs made a huge difference in their lives. </div>
  <div>“If we didn’t have [these virtual recreation programs], I don’t know what we’d do.” 
    
    – CSC Client</div>
  <div>We can foster independence in new ways</div>
  <div>Instructing over the phone instead of side-by-side meant clients needed to be more independent. Clients had to learn how to use equipment and read braille without an instructor physically being by their side. By providing instructions over the phone, clients and their families had to do more for themselves, fostering increased independence. </div>
  <div>“Remote training can be even more empowering to our clients because they have to demonstrate they can do a task [compared to] in-person training when we help them step-by-step. Now they have to listen and perform.” 
    
    - CSC Rehabilitation Staff Member </div>
  <div>We can foster independence in new ways</div>
  <div>Advocacy for the blind and visually impaired community is needed now more than ever. In a world designed for people who are sighted, many safety protocols regarding COVID-19 were put in place without full accessibility to people who live with disabilities. For example, arrows on the floor of stores indicating the flow of traffic are not accessible for people without sight. Advocacy, education and outreach efforts to create a more inclusive world for people of all abilities will continue to be a priority for Cleveland Sight Center.</div>
  <div>The future will only be more fruitful because of the lessons learned, and we continue to learn, during the COVID-19 pandemic. We all continue to see “what is possible” because of the resilience of clients, staff, donors and volunteers. </div>

  <h2>Thank You Donors and Volunteers! </h2>
  <div>Thank you for believing that the blind and visually impaired community can achieve anything a sighted person can. Your support allowed us to continue to be a beacon of hope.</div>
  <div>Because of you, $2,410,337 was donated and 5,200 volunteer hours were completed in support of our clients. This support enabled CSC staff to focus on helping clients thrive during this difficult time. </div>
  <div>“The past year has been so depressing, so dark, so hopeless. After my visit with Cleveland Sight Center I was able to acquire  the recommended magnifiers and lights. Now I am able to read recipes, cooking instructions, prescription labels, microwave panels, ingredients, my mail and my own writing! I am so grateful for the advice, information and support given to me by the Cleveland Sight Center. A ray of hope. A ray of light on my cloudy days.”
